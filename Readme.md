## Hey All

#### I have created a project i.e. Simon-Says Game which tests one's power of memorizing at this link - https://devlopermm.github.io/Simon-Says-game/

Note: Browser can ask you for some security things, you can just allow for now (if asked).

#### This project may not be much appealing to you as it uses very basic HTML, CSS, Javascript but I learnt a lot while building it.

#### I am currently working on some good projects and will deploy them when feels them to be good enough.

###### Have a good day!
